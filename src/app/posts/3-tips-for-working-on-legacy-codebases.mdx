## Introduction

A few years back I was approached by my former employer and asked if I wanted to participate in a project where we would 
update an old PHP affiliate marketing website. The website in question was a well established domain with a high volume of traffic.
It performed well in terms of conversion but it's age was definitely starting to show, in terms of aesthetics and performance. 

At the time of this update I was a starry eyed junior engineer, and saw this as a golden opportunity to drag this old sack of shi... 
shippable code int the 21st century. I was eager to overhaul everything and fix every single issue I had with the code base.
However, as most junior devs quickly learn, that was never going to happen.



## 1. You won't have time to fix everything

The harsh reality is that 9 times out of 10 the stakeholders are looking for as quick of a turnaround as they can get.
I've worked on many legacy websites and rarely would the opportunity arise for a complete rebuild. 
I would have loved nothing more than to rebuild this Symphony 2 website from the ground up in something 
like Vue JS and Tailwind CSS. But unfortunately time and resources are always a factor and you're going to have to 
make some sacrifices. Ideally eleminating as much tech debt as you can with the time you have.

## 2. Don't be afraid to ask the stupid questions

When dealing with a legacy site there's a good chance that the original devs are no longer around 
to explain why certain decisions were made. If you're lucky there is well commented, well structured 
code to work with, if you're extremely lucky there are even Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)
for why these decisions were made. But I'm willing to bet that this isn't the case for a lot of organisitions.
This can leave you up ship creek without a paddle, trying to figure out why things were done a certain way, 
and if certain logic is still necessary.

This is why asking questions, even ones that might seem stupid, is critical. 
It helps uncover the reasons behind old decisions and can shed light on potential "gotchas". Donâ€™t be 
afraid of coming across as inexperienced, this will save on potentialback tracking later down the line. 
And often, from what I have seen over the years, it is the most experienced engineers asking these questions.

## 3. Know when to push back and challenge decisions

It's important to be a productive member of your team, you want to get on with your team, sadly there are 
times when you need to push back against decisions that you don't agree with.
 It could be someone suggests forgoing unit tests in an attempt to save dev time, arguing against 
cutting corners that could lead to other types of tech-debt, or questioning the flow of provided design mock-ups.

Pushing back is not meant to be confrontational but ensuring you and your team have healthy discussion
and set yourselves up for success. This means knowing when to speak up and 
provide well-reasoned arguments for why a certain approach may not be the best decision.

## Conclusion*
Updating old websites is not an easy thing to do, but when you take a step back and think 
about your approach it can be a very fulfilling project. It will help you hone your technical 
skills as a developer and in some cases as a colleague. You won't be able to fix everything, 
and that's just how it goes.Focus on the improvements that deliver the most value, ask questions, 
and push back when necessary.
