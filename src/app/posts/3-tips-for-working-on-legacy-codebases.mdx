## Introduction

A few years back I was approached by my former employer and asked if I wanted to participate in a project where we would 
update an old PHP website. The website in question was a well established domain with a high volume of traffic.
Because of this high traffic, the strategy decided upon by management was to take small sections of the site, 
update them with the new stack and then slowly roll the pages out to users. 

## 1. You can't fix everything

At the time of this update I was a starry eyed junior engineer that thought I would be able to fix every single problem
this website had. It would be using the newest tech, have perfect Lighthouse scores and all the nassty old code would be deleted forever.
Unfortunately this was far from the truth.

## 2. Don't be afraid to ask the stupid questions

When you're dealing with a legacy system, there's a good chance that the original developers are no longer around 
to explain why certain decisions were made. This can leave you in the dark, trying to figure out how things work 
and why they were done a certain way.

Asking questions, even ones that might seem basic or obvious, is crucial. It helps uncover the rationale behind 
existing implementations and can reveal potential pitfalls in your modernization efforts. Don’t let fear of looking 
inexperienced prevent you from gaining the clarity needed to move forward. Often, 
these questions can lead to a deeper understanding and uncover issues that might not have been apparent at first glance.

## 3. Know when to push back and challenge decisions 

While it's important to be a team player, there are times when you need to push back against decisions that might not 
be in the best interest of the project. This could involve advocating for better testing practices, arguing against 
cutting corners that could lead to technical debt, or simply questioning the feasibility of certain features given 
the current system's limitations.

Pushing back is not about being confrontational but about ensuring that the project stays on track and that the 
solutions implemented are sustainable in the long term. This means having the courage to voice concerns and 
provide well-reasoned arguments for alternative approaches. It’s about finding a balance between meeting 
immediate business needs and laying a solid foundation for future development.

## Conclusion

Modernizing an old website is a challenging but rewarding task. It requires a blend of technical skills, 
critical thinking, and effective communication. You won't be able to fix everything, and that's okay.
 Focus on making meaningful improvements, don't hesitate to ask questions, and stand your ground when necessary. 
 These experiences will not only help you grow as a developer but also contribute to creating a better, 
 more maintainable system for the future.
